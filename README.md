# Arduino Projects with PlatformIO

This repository contains two Arduino projects developed using the PlatformIO enviroment. Each project addresses a specific problem and provides a solution through Arduino programming.

## Projects

### 1. LED Sequence Control

This project controls a sequence of four LEDs using four push buttons:
- Two buttons control the direction of the sequence (forward or backward).
- The other two buttons control the speed at which the LEDs turn on.

#### Features:
- LED sequence control.
- Direction control (forward and backward).
- Sequence speed control.

### 2. Debounce Mechanism

This project implements a software-based debounce mechanism using a finite state machine (FSM) architecture.

#### Features:
- Button debounce elimination.
- Implementation of a finite state machine for debounce control.

## Requirements

To run these projects, you will need:
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed on your system.
- A microcontroller compatible with Arduino.
